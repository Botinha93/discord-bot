		"1164414761723764897": "\"And here’s the part where the circlejerk grows to a proportion which will drive outsiders to dismiss the series as unfunny/overrated/cringe/etc etc, in turn giving birth to another opposing circlejerk of people who either never watched it or went in almost solely with the intent of complaining about the series and acting like it’s the worst thing that’s happened to humanity since the Holocaust, said circlejerk growing to equal or overwhelming size compared to the fandom, resulting in the hype for the series spiralling down into a black abyss as it gets mentioned alongside Genshin Impact, the Owl House, Helluva Boss, Omori, One Piece, Friday Night Funkin, and a slew of other properties forever associated with the Tumblr-esque overzealous side of the internet never to recover from this fate no matter how much it improves later down the line. A war will start between the over-obsessive fans and the stubborn haters over who can flood the internet with as much painfully unfunny slander memes as possible which will cause other outsiders previously unaware of the situation who might otherwise be interested in visiting this brand new IP to swear off of it for life based on community response. A vicious cycle of hate and misery permeates the internet and adds onto the pile of terrible fandoms to avoid at all costs, users labelling new IP fans as pedophiles for some reason, essay YouTubers posting long unwinded tangents about the rise and fall of this series, and any attempt at reviving hype either failing miserably or met with laughs ultimately resulting in the series being degraded to nothing more than a joke to fuel meme dumps on niche shitposting subreddits and bait & switch clips on TikTok. This is Patient Zero, this is where everything goes to shit, all potential to form another community to share and enjoy content with one another down the drain and sealed away.\n\nThis is the beginning of the end.
